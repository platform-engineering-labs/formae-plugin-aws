    This is the showcase that demonstrates how to work with formae from Day 0 to Day N.

    This forma is supposed to be used in patch mode and demonstrate how to make minimal
    cross-cutting changes. Typical use cases would be to harden systems, adding consistent
    metadata, compliance, cost and performance optimizations and similar. Anyone in the team
    should be able to apply this forma, but its sweet spot is to be used by security engineers,
    consultants and similar roles.

    Apply this forma in patch mode to add a specific tag to multiple existing resources.

    One can run destroy using this forma, but it shouldn't be done.
